# 16-BIT-CENTRAL-PROCESSING-UNIT
Designed and implemented a functional 16-bit CPU from the ground up. This project involved creating the core architecture, including a custom ALU, Control Unit, RAM, and ROM. The CPU was built in Verilog HDL, simulating the complete fetch-execute cycle and a custom instruction set for arithmetic, logic, and data transfer operations.  for
